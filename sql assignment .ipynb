    "Answer = A database is a structured collection of data that is organized in a way that enables easy access, management, and updating of that data. It can be organized in various ways and stored in systems known as database management systems (DBMS).\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are different types of database management systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases (Relational Databases):\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are based on the relational model. They use Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data.\n",
    "They have a predefined schema where data is stored in tables. These tables have rows and columns with predefined data types.\n",
    "SQL databases ensure data integrity through ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.\n",
    "Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.\n",
    "NoSQL Databases (Non-relational Databases):\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, as the name implies, do not use the structured query language (SQL). They offer a more flexible data model.\n",
    "They donâ€™t have a fixed schema. Data is stored in a variety of ways such as key-value pairs, wide-column stores, document stores, or graph databases.\n",
    "NoSQL databases are more scalable and can handle large volumes of data or unstructured data more efficiently.\n",
    "They might sacrifice some of the consistency provided by SQL databases for higher performance and scalability.\n",
    "Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase.\n",
    "Differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are based on a fixed schema where data is stored in tables with rows and columns.\n",
    "NoSQL databases offer more flexibility in data models, supporting documents, key-value pairs, graphs, etc.\n",
    "Query Language:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases use SQL as their query language.\n",
    "NoSQL databases have their query languages tailored to the type of database. For instance, MongoDB uses a query language that is different from SQL.\n",
    "Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are generally vertically scalable, meaning they scale by increasing the horse-power (CPU, RAM, SSD) of the hardware.\n",
    "NoSQL databases are usually horizontally scalable, allowing you to add more servers to handle the load.\n",
    "Consistency vs. Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases prioritize consistency, ensuring that data remains accurate after any transaction.\n",
    "NoSQL databases may sacrifice consistency for scalability and performance in some cases, offering eventual consistency where all nodes in a distributed system will eventually become consistent.\n",
    "Both SQL and NoSQL databases have their strengths and weaknesses, and the choice between them depends on the specific needs of the application, data structure, and scalability requirements."

    "A Foreign Key is a column or set of columns in a table that establishes a link between data in two tables.\n",
    "It creates a relationship between two tables by referencing the Primary Key of another table.\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Answer = In SQL, when constructing a query with multiple clauses, the order of execution is determined by the logical processing order of the clauses. The general sequence of the clauses in a SQL query is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "FROM: This clause specifies the tables from which the data will be selected or joined.\n",
    "\n",
    "WHERE: The WHERE clause filters the rows returned based on specified conditions. It restricts the rows to those that satisfy the given criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "GROUP BY: This clause is used to group rows that have the same values. It's commonly used in combination with aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "HAVING: The HAVING clause works similarly to the WHERE clause but is applied after the GROUP BY clause. It filters grouped rows based on conditions specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT: This clause selects the columns to be displayed in the result set. It comes after the processing of rows and grouping but before any ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "ORDER BY: The ORDER BY clause sorts the result set based on specified columns either in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "LIMIT/OFFSET (if applicable): These clauses are used to limit the number of rows returned from the query or to skip a certain number of rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sequence might change slightly in certain scenarios and based on the SQL engine or database management system being used. For instance, some databases might allow the usage of SELECT before GROUP BY when using aggregate functions, but in most cases, the logical order mentioned above is followed.\n",
